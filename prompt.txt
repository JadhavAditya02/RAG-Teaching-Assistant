I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Heading, Paragraphs and Links","number":"4","start":0.0,"end":12.28,"text":" In today's video, I will tell you about heading and paragraphs.  Along with that, I will tell you about anchor text.  If you have found this course awesome till now,  then do like this video.  Your likes will help me in bringing such free courses."},{"title":"Heading, Paragraphs and Links","number":"4","start":362.32,"end":372.32,"text":" Like here, why the term hypertext and markup language was there.  This is heading 2.  What is the main heading page? HTML introduction.  After this, all these are heading.  I had to give a quick exercise in this also."},{"title":"Inline & Block Elements in HTML","number":"8","start":233.0,"end":243.0,"text":" I will tell you about it.  But now I want to show you how it works.  So see what happened.  I wrote here I am a paragraph.  What is paragraph? A block element."},{"title":"Heading, Paragraphs and Links","number":"4","start":148.4,"end":158.4,"text":" All these things are information.  The main content is inside the body.  Now there is a tag inside the body to put a heading.  Its name is h1.  And I am going to write my bookmarks on it."},{"title":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML","number":"5","start":720.64,"end":728.64,"text":" Now here I can group  the content of my header and footer  with T head and T foot in this way.  So what will be the header of my table?  This is what I have written here."}]

"what is heading and paragraphs"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
